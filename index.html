 <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I grew up playing computer games on console and PCs. I have learnt to troubleshoot PCs, setup LANs, build pc and more from my hobby. After spending 6 years in the Navy as an electronics technician I wanted to start my career path towards IT. So I got myself a certificate IV in Information Technology (Networking). Then I started my studies towards Bachelors in Information Technology through RMIT university.</p>
