<p><b>Background Information:</b>
</p>
<p>Born and raised in Australia. 
I have a certificate iv in Engineering (electronics) and
 a certificate iv in Information Technology. 
 I have completed two units at RMIT University so far and 
 am currently continuing my studies through them working 
 towards a Bachelors in Information Technology.
 In my spare time I like to study, play computer games and 
 spending time with my chihuahua Daisy.
</p>
<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I grew up playing computer games on console and PCs. I have 
learnt to troubleshoot PCs, setup LANs, build PCs and more from 
my hobby. After spending 6 years in the Navy as an electronics 
technician I wanted to start my career path towards IT. So I got 
myself a certificate IV in Information Technology (Networking). 
Then I started my studies towards Bachelors in Information Technology
 through RMIT university.
</p>
<p>I chose to learn through RMIT because in my opinion RMIT is a
 leading technical university in Australia. RMIT offers the Bachelors
 in Information Technology course online, which appeals to my 
 personal circumstances.
</p>
<p>During my studies I expect to learn about professional software,
 programming, databases, ethics and more. The course offers several
 minor streams to help solidify IT knowledge into an industry specific
 direction. My current plan is to undertake the minor in internet 
 design so I will be learning about project development and digital design concepts.
