<h1>Personal Details</h1>
<p class="bold">Name:</p><p>Shane Miller</p>
<p class="bold">Student #:</p><p>s3427238</p>
<p class="bold">Email:</p><p>s3427238@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
<p class="bold">Background Information:</p>
<p>Born and raised in Australia. 
I have a certificate iv in Engineering (electronics) and
 a certificate iv in Information Technology. 
 I have completed two units at RMIT University so far and am currently continuing my studies through them working towards a Bachelors in Information Technology.
 In my spare time I like to study, play computer games and spending time with my chihuahua Daisy.
</p>
 
<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I grew up playing computer games on console and PCs. I have learnt to troubleshoot PCs, setup LANs, build PCs and more from my hobby. After spending 6 years in the Navy as an electronics technician I wanted to start my career path towards IT. So I got myself a certificate IV in Information Technology (Networking). Then I started my studies towards Bachelors in Information Technology through RMIT university.
</p>
<p>I chose to learn through RMIT because in my opinion RMIT is a leading technical university in Australia. RMIT offers the Bachelors in Information Technology course online, which appeals to my personal circumstances.
</p>
<p>During my studies I expect to learn about professional software, programming, databases, ethics and more. The course offers several minor streams to help solidify IT knowledge into an industry specific direction. My current plan is to undertake the minor in internet design so I will be learning about project development and digital design concepts.
